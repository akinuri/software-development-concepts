# Software Development Concepts <sub><sup>(2020-12-16)</sup></sub>

I'm a self-taught programmer. That means I'm both the student and the teacher. While being the student (relatively) easy, the teacher has more responsibility. You need to get to know the student and modify the ways of your teaching.

As a student, I'm constantly bombarded with new information. Reading/knowing a topic is not enough. One has to try to see the bigger picture, make associations, have a deeper understanding. That's where the Internet fails (me). Don't get me wrong. I love the Internet. You can find anything on it. But it's all fragmented. Whenever I read about a new topic, I have to move mountains to truly understand it.

You might be thinking that maybe I'm exaggerating the situation, but no, I'm not. I want to understand something enough to teach it to someone else. That's what "truly understand" means to me. In other words, _"If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself."_

This is my attempt at fixing the fragmented information. I'll be storing everything that I come across here. Group them, associate them, graph them, etc. And, spoiler, one of the goals of mine is to write a book. So these will come in handy, later.

## Update <sub><sup>(2021-01-14)</sup></sub>

It's been almost a month since I started this repo, and it's getting bigger by the day. I had many links to resources in my hard drive and in browser bookmarks. I've started collecting them all in one place. So this (repo) might get bigger than I expected. It's not strictly related to software development anymore. I mean, it has (or will) become more encompassing. Therefore, it might require a rename later. ... Computer Science?
