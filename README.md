# Software Development Concepts
I'm a self-taught programmer. That means I'm both the student and the teacher. While being the student (relatively) easy, the teacher has more responsibility. You need to get to know the student and modify the ways of your teaching.

As a student, I'm constantly bombarded with new information. Reading/knowing a topic is not enough. One has to try to see the bigger picture, make associations, have a deeper understanding. That's where the Internet fails (me). Don't get me wrong. I love the Internet. You can find everything on it. But it's all fragmented. Whenever I read about a new topic, I have to move mountains to fully understand it.

You might be thinking that maybe I'm exaggerating the situation, but no, I'm not. I want to understand something enough to teach it to someone else. That's what "trully understand" means to me. In other words, _"If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself."_

This is my attempt at fixing the fragmented information. I'll be storing everything that I come across here. Group them, associate them, graph them, etc. And, spoiler, one of the goals of mine is to write a book. So these will come in handy, later.
