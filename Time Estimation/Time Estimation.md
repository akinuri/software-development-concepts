## [Brooks's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)

* "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"
* under certain conditions, an incremental person when added to a project makes it take more, not less time


## [Death march (project management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(project_management))
* a death march is a project which participants believe to be destined for failure, or that requires a stretch of unsustainable overwork
* Death marches are usually a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in scheduling or feature scope, and often result from a lack of appropriate documentation, relevant training, or outside expertise needed to complete the project.


## [Hard-easy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard%E2%80%93easy_effect)

* The hard–easy effect is a cognitive bias that manifests itself as a tendency to overestimate the probability of one's success at a task perceived as hard, and to underestimate the likelihood of one's success at a task perceived as easy


## [Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law)

* "Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."


## [Valve Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation#Valve_Time)

* Valve time is an industry term used jokingly with game releases from Valve, used to acknowledge the difference between the "promised" date for released content stated by Valve and to the "actual" release date; "Valve Time" includes delays but also includes some content that was released earlier than expected.


## [Ninety–ninety rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule)

* "The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."

* This adds up to 180%, making a wry allusion to the notoriety of software development projects significantly over-running their schedules.

* In short, it often takes both more time and more coding than expected to complete a project.


## [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

* The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.


## [Planning fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy)

* The planning fallacy is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias and underestimate the time needed.


## [Small matter of programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_matter_of_programming)

* In software development, small matter of programming (SMOP) or simple matter of programming is a phrase used to ironically indicate that a suggested feature or design change would in fact require a great deal of effort.

* It points out that although the change is clearly possible, it would be very laborious to actually perform. It often implies that the person proposing the feature underestimates its cost.


## [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)

* Brooks argues that "there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity." He also states that "we cannot expect ever to see two-fold gains every two years" in software development, as there is in hardware development.
