```
only 3 out of 10 projects finish on time and on budget
almost half of them fail to complete within the initially set constraints
2 of them fail miserably in general
While small ones may have a success rate of 70%, only 10% of the big projects succeed.

IT projects should be broken down into small projects to reduce the scope

"developers generally have a 30% error rate when estimating time needed"

The most common pitfall ... is that the only cost considered was the developers’ salary and that’s wrong.
