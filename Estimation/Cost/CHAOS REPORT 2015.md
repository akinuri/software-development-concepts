We have found that most software projects only require a small team
for a short duration in order to deliver value to the organization;
only in very rare cases do projects need to be larger and longer.

Most, if not all, large, complex, multi-year projects are unnecessary.
This is especially true for standard infrastructure softwareâ€”
such as middleware, databases, and system management.
