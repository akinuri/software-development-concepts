DETERMINING THE COSTS OF ERP IMPLEMENTATION - 23630.pdf

```
32% of ERP projects is more costly than planned

'which factors substantially influence ERP implementation costs'

His conclusion was, since
most approaches are based upon the use of the
number of lines of source code or some synthetic
variable such as function point to assess the size of
the project, these approaches are not applicable.

Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO)

Based on an
extensive field study, using data from 43 (European)
SAP R/3 implementation projects, she identifies
three constituting elements for such a size metric:
    Size of the organization
        This reflects its inertia, its ability to resist change.
    Size of the configuration.
        This is expressed in
        the number of modules or sub-modules that is to
        be implemented.
    Size of the implementation.
        This is expressed
        with number of users involved, since these
        indicate training and reorganization effort.

Software Code Estimation
    Size
        number of lines of code
        number of function points

        complexity
        specification stability
