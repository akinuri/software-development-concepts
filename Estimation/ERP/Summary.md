DETERMINING THE COSTS OF ERP IMPLEMENTATION - 23630.pdf

```
32% of ERP projects is more costly than planned

'which factors substantially influence ERP implementation costs'

His conclusion was, since
most approaches are based upon the use of the
number of lines of source code or some synthetic
variable such as function point to assess the size of
the project, these approaches are not applicable.

Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO)

Based on an
extensive field study, using data from 43 (European)
SAP R/3 implementation projects, she identifies
three constituting elements for such a size metric:
    Size of the organization
        This reflects its inertia, its ability to resist change.
    Size of the configuration.
        This is expressed in
        the number of modules or sub-modules that is to
        be implemented.
    Size of the implementation.
        This is expressed
        with number of users involved, since these
        indicate training and reorganization effort.

Software Code Estimation
    Size
        number of lines of code
        number of function points
        number of modules / sub modules
        number of interfaces
    What with
        resources
            people
            organization
            systems
    How
        programming approach
    For whom
        number of users
        degree of user involvement
        knowledge and experience of users
    What
        quality
        complexity
        specification stability
        required documentation

Effort estimation methods for ERP projects based on function points a case study-6733.pdf

```
applied these function point based ERP effort estimation methods for specific four modules of the project
    (but says 3 [MM, SD and PM] in the paper?)

traditional effort estimation methods are not appropriate for industrial projects such as ERP projects

SAP Implementation Project
    started in April 2015
    completed in March 2016.
    go-live of the project occurred on 01.01.2016
    last 3 months of the project was for operational support and maintenance

This project consisted implementation of mainly following SAP modules:
    • MM (Material Management)
    • SD (Sales & Distribution)
    • PM (Plant Maintenance)
    • FICO (Finance & Controlling)
    • HR (Human Resource)
    • PP-PI (Production Planning – Process Industries)

Total number of employee for the company is almost 1200
at the beginning of the project total number of SAP users was predicted as 110

The project staff consisted of
    from SAP Consultancy Company
        1 Project Manager
        7 Senior SAP Consultant
        5 Junior SAP Consultant
    from SAP Adopter Company
        1 Project Manager
        3 Process Analyst
        7 SAP Key-User

    Master Data
    Business Processes

1. The COSMIC EPC Method
    Total Effort : 3001 (Person-Hours)
    total size of the project for MM, SD and PM modules
        calculated as 886 Cfs (COSMIC functional size) points
    total effort for MM, SD and PM modules
        implementation for this project is calculated based on COSMIC EPC is 532 Hours
        Realized value for these modules was 378,5 hours
        considering these values Mean Relative Error (MRE) is calculated as 0,40

2. COSMIC-FFP
    total size of the project for MM, SD and PM modules
        COSMIC-FFP: Size = 247 Cfsu
        Refined Approximate COSMIC-FFP: Size = 384 Cfsu
    Realized effort for these modules
        2,15 man-months (considering 8 hours’ working day)
        Based on COSMIC-FFP: Time Delivery = 3 months
        Based on Refined Approximate COSMIC-FFP: Time Delivery = 3,3 months

3. Early Requirements
    estimated effort range as 70-100 hours
    Realized effort for this scenario was 87 man-hours
